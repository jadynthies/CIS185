# HTML Elements Exploration Assignment

**Student Name:** Jadyn  
**Course:** CIS 185
**Assignment One:** HTML Elements Challenge  
**Date:** 10.01.2025

My choosen elements:
- `<small>`: Made fonts smaller to induce a whisper-like tone
- `<li> / <lo>`: Organized a list of payment types
- `<ruby> / <rt>`: Pronouced name of cafe
- `<mark>`: Marked a button as important
- `<del>`: Crossed out text

 CSS style on:
 - `<mark>`
 - `<li> / <lo>`
 - `<summary>`

## Through this assignment, I learned:

- **Creativity**: Using elements both in ways they are ordinarily used and in ways that are more niche for user experience
- **Organization**: Instead of applying styles directly to elements I embedded them at the very top

## Challenges Encountered

- **Organization**: Just like I learned organization, I had trouble with making everything look nice at first
- **Typos**: Sometimes I would mistype something and in turn would make my web page look weird

# HTML Elements Exploration Assignment

**Student Name:** Jadyn  
**Course:** CIS 185
**Assignment One:** HTML Elements Challenge  
**Date:** 10.01.2025

# My choosen elements:
- `<small>`: Made fonts smaller to induce a whisper-like tone

```html
<details>
<summary>Do aliens visit the cafe?</summary>
        <p><small>Sometimes...</small>
        <p>But they just leave crop circles in the parking lot.</p>
</details>
```
-- This was mainly used for creativity. As I played around with elements, I thought this would be fun to add

- `<li> / <lo>`: Organized a list of payment types
 ```html
<p>We accept the following payment methods:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Tulips</li>
        <li>Moon rocks</li>
        <li>Euros</li>
        <li>High-fives</li>
        <li>Dinosaur fossils</li>
        <li>Tap-to-pay</li>
    </ol>
 ```
-- Used as a list of payment options

- `<ruby> / <rt>`: Pronouced name of cafe
- `<mark>`: Marked a button as important
```html
<a href="https://youtu.be/9EYZnSXEla0?si=TEuplLUKji_zC7Uw" target="_blank">
  <button type="button"><mark><strong>"Big Red Button"</strong></mark></button> </a>
```
 -- I realize this is an incorrect use of mark, technically. And I was doing it for creative, non-CSS reasons.
 
 -- I did have to look up how to put all this together because I was struggling for a second. (I think the link
 was confusing me). Mark is intended to highlight a section. In my case, I used it as a non-CSS way to 
 make my big bad button the color red.
 
- `<del>`: Crossed out text

-- Again, I used `<del>` to cross out text in a humourous way.

 CSS style on:
 - `<mark>`
 - `<li> / <lo>`
 - `<summary>`

## Through this assignment, I learned:

- **Creativity**: Using elements both in ways they are ordinarily used, and in ways that are more niche for user experience
- **Organization**: Instead of applying styles directly to elements I embedded them at the top of the code

## Challenges Encountered

- **Organization**: Just like I learned organization, I had trouble with making everything look nice at first
- **Typos**: At times I would mistype something and in turn it would make my web page appear funky
